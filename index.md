# Hedgehog Hall of Bugs

Hedgehog has been out for more than a year now, and it's getting
hard to keep track of all the cool bugs found by users! So, let's
start now.

The Hall of Bugs is intended as a place to accumulate links,
stories, and anecdotes about Hedgehog in the real world. 

This library is maintained by volunteers at no cost to you.
Information about how the library is used is invaluable to us, as
are success stories, no matter how small!

## Call for Submissions!

If you're getting great value out of Hedgehog, we'd love to hear
from you! Submit an issue or PR on the
[Hall of Bugs](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/hallofbugs)
repository and we can add it to this page.

Submissions should include one of:

- Public GitHub issue / PR, if the bug was in a public repo
- A rough description of the bug, your generators, and the counterexample
- CVE link, if the bug had a security impact!
- News coverage of the bug you found! (Someday, surely!)

If you can't say anything publicly, consider just letting us know
you're using the library! Those messages make the maintenance work
much easier. We'd also love to publish vague testimonials.

All of the above will help us to communicate that property-based
testing is an unreasonably effective technique widely used in
industry. Help us spread the word!
